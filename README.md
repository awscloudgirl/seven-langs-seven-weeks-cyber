## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
This repository documents a **seven-week learning journey** across **eight programming languages**.  
Each week, I cover a new core programming concept across all languages with **cybersecurity-flavored examples**.  

By the end, this repo will include:
- Exercises in all 8 languages  
- Mini-projects (brute forcers, scanners, log parsers, web exploits)  
- Larger weekly projects (security tools, automation scripts, concurrent scanners)  
- Daily progress maps in `/progress`
